    "There have been many questions regarding whether or not usage of social media increases anxiety levels. For example, do  TikTok and Facebook posts create an unattainable sense of life success and satisfaction?  Does procrastinating by watching YouTube videos or reading Twitter posts contribute unnecessary stress from deadline pressure? A study was conducted to examine the relationship between social media usage and student anxiety. Students were asked to categorize their social media usage as \"High\" if it exceeded more than 2 hours per day, and then student anxiety levels where scored through as series of questions, with higher scores suggesting higher student anxiety."
